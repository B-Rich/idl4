This subdirectory contains a Makefile that can be used to build
ext2 ramdisk files. When such a ramdisk is loaded via GRUB, the
booter task makes it accessible as a block device (/dev/hdxx)
which can then be mounted by the ext2fs file system.

To create a ramdisk, you must run the Makefile as root, and your
kernel must support loop devices (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=y).
