This is ChacmOS, a component-based operating system that was built during
a systems course at Karlsruhe University. ChacmOS consists of four basic
servers (task server, memory server, name server and file server) and
various other components such as an interactive shell. Every server hosts a
certain number of objects, which can interact with other objects through
an extensible set of interfaces. The system also provides a hierarchical
namespace that can be extended by mounting file systems such as the 
included ext2 file system. However, it is designed to be single-user and,
as a consequence, does not offer a security model.

For generating the necessary communication code, ChacmOS relies on the
IDL4 stub generator. IDL4 produces heavily optimized stub code from 
standard DCOM or CORBA interface definitions. Newer distributions of IDL4
contain ChacmOS as sample code; if you obtained ChacmOS from another
source, you may need to download and install IDL4 separately.

We decided to release ChacmOS under GPL because we think that it might
be useful to others who are building their own systems on top of L4KA.
However, we do not work on the system any more and therefore will not 
provide support for it. If you have any comments or suggestions, please
feel free to contact Andreas Haeberlen at haeberlen@ira.uka.de.
