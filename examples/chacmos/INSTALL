				BUILDING CHACMOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build ChacmOS you will need an ANSI C compiler such as gcc, the
GNU make utility and some disk space. To render the TeX documentation, you
might also need LaTeX.

To start the build, go to the top level directory and edit the Makeconf.local
file; it contains paths to IDL4 and the Hazelnut source tree which you may
need to adapt for your system. Then just do a 'make all'; this should generate 
binaries for the servers and store them in the bin/ subdirectory. This 
directory also contains a sample GRUB configuration file and an ext2 ramdisk, 
which can be mounted at runtime.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    BOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run ChacmOS, you will need:

   - a L4KA kernel suitable for your platform

   - a root pager ('sigma0')

   - the resource manager ('rmgr')
   
   - the GRUB bootloader

The first three are included in the binary distribution available from 
l4ka.org; you can also build these yourself from the CVS sources. The
GRUB loader comes in a separate package. For more detail on how to obtain
and install GRUB, please refer to the original L4KA documentation.

In order to boot ChacmOS, please copy the kernel, the root pager, the
resource manager and the contents of the bin/ subdirectory to your
TFTP root directory. You may need to adjust the relative paths in 
menu.lst. Then boot from your GRUB installation, and ChacmOS should start.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		     		 TESTING CHACMOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing you will see when booting ChacmOS is the kernel's startup
message ('KD# startup'), to which you should respond by hitting 'g'. You
will then see some diagnostic messages, followed - hopefully - by the
shell's command prompt:

      chacmOS:/ > #
      
The # is used as a cursor. You can now enter commands by typing them on the
console:

      chacmOS:/ > help
        cat <file>         displays contents of <file>
        cd <path>          changes working directory to <path>
        debug [on|off]     enables or disables debugging
        dir                shows detailed information about directory
        help               displays the message you're reading
        kd                 enters kernel debugger
        ls                 lists contents of working directory
        mount <bdev> <fs>  mounts a block device into a file system
        pwd                prints path to working directory
        umount <fs>        unmounts the filesystem
      chacmOS:/ > #
      
You should use the 'dir' command to display the contents of the root
directory:

      chacmOS:/ > dir
      dev                <4060001,  2>  -FD-C---        33 bytes
      1 file(s)
      
      chacmOS:/ > #
      
The root directory contains only a single subdirectory called 'dev', in
which all the components started at boot time register their names. 
The 'dev' directory is hosted by a server with task ID 4060001h and has
an object ID of 2. It supports the file interface (F, for reading the
directory's contents), the directory interface (D) and the creator 
interface (C), which is used to create new files or objects. 

You should now try to enter the 'dev' directory and display its contents:

      chacmOS:/ > cd dev
      chacmOS:/dev/ > dir
      ext2fs             <4070001,  0>  ---S----
      namesvr            <4060001,  0>  ----C---
      memory             <4050001,  0>  ----C---
      hda                <4040001, 10>  ------B-   65536 bytes (128 blocks)
      tasksvr            <4040001,  0>  T---C--- TID=4040001
      5 file(s)
      
      chacmOS:/dev/ > #
      
This directory shows that all four basic servers have been loaded properly.
It also shows an additional block device (B) called 'hda', which corresponds 
to the ramdisk image. It can be mounted into the ext2fs filesystem:

      chacmOS:/dev/ > mount hda ext2fs
      chacmOS:/dev/ > dir
      ext2fs             <4070001,  0>  -FDS----
      namesvr            <4060001,  0>  ----C---
      memory             <4050001,  0>  ----C---
      hda                <4040001, 10>  ------B-   65536 bytes (128 blocks)
      tasksvr            <4040001,  0>  T---C--- TID=4040001
      5 file(s)
      
      chacmOS:/dev/ > #

The effect of the 'mount' command is shown by the interfaces supported by
ext2fs: It now has two additional interfaces (F and D) and acts as a 
directory. You can enter it with the cd command:

      chacmOS:/dev/ > cd ext2fs
      chacmOS:/dev/ext2fs/ > dir
      ...
      
      chacmOS:/dev/ext2fs/ > #
      
The ramdisk should contain an executable called 'tester'. You can start this
application:

      chacmOS:/dev/ext2fs/ > tester
      ...
      
      chacmOS:/dev/ext2fs/ > #
      
The program will run some compatibility tests on the system and - again,
hopefully - report success. You now have a fully functional ChacmOS system.

Enjoy! :-)
