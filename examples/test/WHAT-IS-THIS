This directory contains the IDL4 test suite. It uses various interface 
descriptions from the idl/ subdirectory to build an application which
contains test implementations for all of them. This application can then
be booted as a root task on top of the microkernel; it invokes and tests
every operation to verify that the generated stubs are correct.
